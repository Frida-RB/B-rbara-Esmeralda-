  <h1> Human Circulatory System  </h1>
  <p>
  The circulatory system transports blood, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the body. It includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood, working together to maintain life and health.

  The circulatory system is essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste products. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood through arteries to the body, while veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.

    The circulatory system is essential for maintaining life by transporting blood, oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. It consists of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    The heart, a muscular organ, pumps oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through arteries. Veins then carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart and lungs to be re-oxygenated.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The circulatory system has several important functions, including:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissues.</li>
    <li>Removing carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes.</li>
    <li>Transporting hormones and other signaling molecules.</li>
    <li>Helping regulate body temperature.</li>
    <li>Protecting the body from infections and blood loss.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Maintaining a healthy circulatory system is crucial for overall health. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking can help keep your heart and blood vessels in good condition.
